                    <h1>Program Structure</h1>
                    <p>This section breaks down the flow of the training and what to expect weekly.</p>

                    <h2>Self-Study</h2>
                    <p>Each week are will be given a pre-training assignment (PTA) that will cover that weeks topic. These PTA's will come in either an interactive Academy item or as an electronic PDF. It is your responsibility to use the self-study time
                        to complete these assignments and any supplemental resources</p>

                    <h2>Make-Up Sessions</h2>
                    <p>Monday mornings are also a great opportunity to make up any session you may have missed previously due to an absence</p>

                    <h2>Workbook</h2>
                    <p>In an effort to keep your skills sharp and to offer you varying challenges. The workbook will be filled with exercises for you to tackle during this time as well</p>

                    <h2>Pre-Training Assignments (Graded)</h2>
                    <p class="pta">In the realm of software development, the number one metric for achieving confidence and improving your skills is to accomplish as many “hands-on” activities as possible. The more you use the tools you will need as a developer, the
                        greater your comfort will be when it comes time to use these tools. The more lines of actual code you write implementing the concepts taught to you, the more confident you will be in your abilities when you become a full-time developer.</p>
                    <p class="pta">Since your time for classroom training is limited in this program, it is of utmost importance that the majority of that time is spent practicing developer skills and doing activities that strengthen your comprehension of the concepts.
                        To ensure we provide you with the hands-on time you need, the amount of lecture time you will receive will be minimal. However, we need to make sure you have knowledge and basic comprehension of the terms and theories behind the
                        practices. This is the purpose of the pre-training assignment.</p>
                    <p class="pta">By providing you with “homework” before you show up for the training, we are giving you the opportunity to research the concepts on your own. This allows you to formulate your own thoughts and ideas on the subject as well as draft
                        any questions you would like answered for clarification. You will be provided with ample time to complete the assignment, as well as given a list of potential resources to find the required information. However, you have the freedom
                        to select and identify other resources. The key point is that you express the answers in your own terms.</p>
                    <p class="pta">Each course has a pre-training assignment associated with it. There is time allotted within the schedule for you to work on the pre-training assignments.</p>
                    <p class="pta">Keep in mind that a trainer will be available to you during the pre-training assignment time allotted in your schedule.</p>

                    <h2>Course Reviews</h2>
                    <p>Course reviews follow the pre-training assignments and are designed to reinforce the material covered in the pre-training assignments. These sessions are led by the facilitator and include various activities to really drive the content
                        home.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Course Labs</h2>
                    <p class="pta">The labs are designed to give you the opportunity to apply the concepts we discuss in pre-training assignments and the review in code.  You will be given a set of requirements and your job is to find a solution for each lab exercise.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pta">While it will provide you with examples of how a particular section should be constructed or a code block might look, it will not provide the exact code or all the specific details for your implementation. It is expected that you will
                        find a way to accomplish the lab requirements using the tools available to you. Don’t forget, we’re here to help!</p>
                    <p class="pta">We will spend time, in class, exploring the various solutions developed by you and your DEV I peers.</p>

                    <h2>Supplemental Instructor Led Trainings</h2>
                    <p>These sessions are 2 - 3 hour training's led by the instructor on specific tools and/or resources you should utilize when coding. The difference with these types of training in comparison to the other training's you will receive is
                        that these will not have a separate session for Reviews and Labs. Instead, we will spend the entire session going over the concepts and applying them throughout the duration.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Quiz (Graded)</h2>
                    <p>Booster quizzes are given on the Tuesday of every week. These fill-in-the-blank / multiple choice questions allow you to see how much information you were able to retain from the previous week's topic.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
                    <p>Each week we will take everything we have learned up until that point, and spend an afternoon building applications that bring all the pieces together.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Practical Assessments (Graded)</h2>
                    <p>Practical assessments are similar to labs, but graded. You will be given a set of requirements and then a duration of time to complete as much as you can. This gives you the opportunity to demonstrate what skills you gained throughout
                        that week of training. Each practical assessment will focus on that weeks topic but will have pieces of skills acquired from previous week's sessions.</p>

                    <h2>Midterm Project (Graded)</h2>
                    <p>The midterm project will be a set of requirements to build out a Console application that utilizes all the topics we have covered up until this point. Your final product will be presented on the last day of this week.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Final Project (Graded)</h2>
                    <p>The final project will be a set of requirements to build out a Console application that utilizes all the topics we have covered throughout the entire program. Your final product will be presented on the last day of this week.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Retrospectives and 1-on-1's</h2>
                    <p class="pta">Every week you will be given a chance to provide feedback on the training sessions, program, and trainers. Retrospective sessions (Retros) will be facilitated to gather your feedback in hopes of improving future iterations.</p>
                    <p class="pta">In addition to the Retro's, your team leader will be meeting with you 1-on-1 every two weeks. The purpose of these 1-on-1's is to provide you with your progress in the program and ensure that you have the opportunity to discuss any
                        concerns you may have.

                        <li>Teach you C#</li>
                        <li>Provide you with the tools, resources, and training environment to attribute to your success</li>
                        <li>Provide you with world class content, training, and facilitation</li>
                        <li>Give you the foundation to be a Application Developer here at UWM</li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Be on Time:</strong> There is a lot of material to cover in the Dev I program. The content developers worked hard to create training sessions that maximize the short time available. When you are late, you hold up the training and disrupt
                            the session.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Participate:</strong> Being in the Dev I program is a privilege. Where else do you get paid to learn a valuable career skill? We ask that in return, you take it seriously and participate in the training session.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Communicate:</strong>
                            While you are in the program, the members of the training team are responsible for you. If you have any issues, please communicate them to us right away.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Use of Technology:</strong> You will be informed when you should use your laptop during a session. That is the only time technology is permitted in a training session. Open laptops and mobile use are a distraction to those around you.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Ask Questions:</strong> You are learning new concepts and skills that are not easy to grasp. Make sure to ask all the questions you have. If you start to fall behind and don't ask questions, you will have difficulty comprehending the next
                            sessions.

                    <ul class="expectation-list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Work Schedule:</strong> You are scheduled to be at work from 9 am to 6 pm, Monday through Friday. This includes a one hour lunch everyday. The expectation is that you are in class and ready to learn by 9:30 on these days.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Tardiness and Absences:</strong> Life happens and we acknowledge that. If you do plan on being absent or late, please reach out to your leader as soon as possible. It is your responsibility to obtain any information and/or material you
                            may have missed during your absence.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Respect:</strong> This goes without saying, but respect is of the upmost importance throughout this program. This includes team members, training team, leaders, and of course your peers. Adhering to a little respect will allow us to cultivate
                            a positive culture through the many weeks you will be in the program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Integrity:</strong> We expect that any assigned work you submit for grading is a product of your development. Leveraging resources such as the internet is acceptable as long as you can explain what is going on. Blatantly copying and pasting,
                            or passing the work of peers as your own, will not be tolerated.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Making the Grade:</strong> The expectation is that you maintain a 70% average throughout the program. There will be two check-points. The midterm and the final assessment. If you are not at the required average at either of these points
                            you will have conversations with your leader to discuss further options. Although we value the score you receive in the program, it is not the end all. You are being evaluated throughout the entire experience.
